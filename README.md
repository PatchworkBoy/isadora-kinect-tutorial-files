##Original Release Statement
>Dear Community,
>
>I'm happy to present to you a three-part series on working with the Kinect using 
>Isadora. These tutorials, written by Montgomery Martin, were based on techniques 
>presented by Mark Coniglio during Troika Ranchâ€™s Live-I Workshop in July 2015. 
>They now live on the main TroikaTronix site.
>
>Over the three part tutorial, we discuss how to use the open-source sketchbook 
>application Processing to act as a communication bridge between the Kinect 
>hardware and Isadora.
>
>[Part 1](http://troikatronix.com/support/kb/kinect-tutorial-part1/) serves as an 
>introduction to the Kinect and what it can offer, along with some important points 
>about particular versions of the camera:
>
>In [Part 2](http://troikatronix.com/support/kb/kinect-tutorial-part2/) of this 
>tutorial, we will learn how to download, install, and configure Processing to receive 
>full body motion data and infrared video from an Xbox Kinect motion sensor. 
>
>In [Part 3](http://troikatronix.com/support/kb/kinect-tutorial-part3/), you will learn 
>how to set up Isadora to receive the OSC and Syphon feeds that Processing broadcasts 
>from the Xbox 360 Kinect camera.
>
>Thank you especially to the rest of the TroikaTronix team for their valuable feedback 
>and assistance in compiling, reviewing, and editing these tutorials: Mark Coniglio, 
>Jamie Griffiths, and Ryan Webber, Michel Weber and Graham Thorne.
>
>Cheers, and enjoy!
>
>Sincerely,
>Monty Martin and The [TroikaTronix](http://troikatronix.com/community/) Team
